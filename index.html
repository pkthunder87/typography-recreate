          SpaceX successfully launches reused Dragon spacecraft for ISS resupply
        </h1>
        <p class="post-meta">
          June 11, 2017 by Joshua Gunn—<a href="#">Technology</a>,
          <a href="#"><span class="allsmallcaps">ISS</span></a
          >, <a href="#">Universe</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          SpaceX’s <span class="allsmallcaps">CRS-11</span> launch on Saturday
          was a success, bringing a Dragon spacecraft loaded down with nearly
          6,000 lbs of supplies and research equipment on board to orbit. The
          twist was that SpaceX already sent this Dragon capsule up to resupply
          the International Space Station once before—back in September 2014,
          when it carried cargo to the
          <span class="allsmallcaps">ISS</span> prior to being recovered and
          refurbished post-mission.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="big-quote">
          &ldquo; SpaceX is working on Dragon 2, a capsule designed to bring
          crew to and from the <span class="allsmallcaps">ISS</span>&rdquo;.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The successful relaunch of a recycled Dragon is another historic
          milestone for SpaceX, which is aiming to reuse various parts of its
          launch and spacecraft equipment in order to help lower the cost of
          getting stuff to space. This is key to its aim of making launching a
          lucrative and profitable business, and also to it achieving its goal
          of flying missions, including crewed operations, to Mars.
        </p>
        <h2>The goal of the mission</h2>
        <p>
          After SpaceX’s Falcon 9 (not a reused one, this time) delivered the
          Dragon to orbit, it decoupled from the craft about 10 minutes after
          the original liftoff, and then deployed its solar wings to harvest
          energy for the rest of its trip to the
          <span class="allsmallcaps">ISS</span>.
        </p>
        <img

          alt="ISS"
        />
        <p>
          The Dragon will attempt to dock with the
          <span class="allsmallcaps">ISS</span> around 36 hours from launch,
          when space station crew will attempt to capture the craft using the
          facility’s 57.7-foot Canadian-made robotic arm. If this Dragon
          completes the rest of its mission as planned, it’ll be recovered,
          refurbished and hopefully reused in a future mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          SpaceX is working on Dragon 2, a capsule designed to bring crew to and
          from the <span class="allsmallcaps">ISS</span>, and hopes to run test
          flights with astronauts on board beginning next year.
