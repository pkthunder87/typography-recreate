        SpaceX successfully launches reused Dragon spacecraft for ISS resupply
      </h1>
      <p>
        SpaceX’s CRS-11 launch on Saturday was a success, bringing a Dragon
        spacecraft loaded down with nearly 6,000 lbs of supplies and research
        equipment on board to orbit. The twist was that SpaceX already sent this
        Dragon capsule up to resupply the International Space Station once
        before—back in September 2014, when it carried cargo to the ISS prior to
        being recovered and refurbished post-mission.

        The successful relaunch of a recycled Dragon is another historic
        milestone for SpaceX, which is aiming to reuse various parts of its
        launch and spacecraft equipment in order to help lower the cost of
        getting stuff to space. This is key to its aim of making launching a
        lucrative and profitable business, and also to it achieving its goal of
        flying missions, including crewed operations, to Mars.
